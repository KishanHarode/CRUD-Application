          A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a fundamental software concept used for managing data. 
          When building such an application using Bootstrap, you can leverage its sleek and responsive design components 
          to create an intuitive user interface. Bootstrap provides pre-designed elements like buttons, forms, and grids, which can be easily integrated into your React components for seamless CRUD operations.

          In the provided code snippet, we have a basic React component named "About".
           To integrate Bootstrap into this component, you would typically import Bootstrap's CSS file into your 
           project to utilize its styling classes. Additionally, you can utilize Bootstrap's layout grid system to
            organize your application's components effectively.

          For example, you can use Bootstrap's grid system to structure the layout of your CRUD application's main page,
           with sections for displaying data, forms for inputting new data, and buttons for triggering CRUD operations. 
           By applying Bootstrap's responsive classes, your application will adapt well to various screen sizes, 
           ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

          To implement CRUD functionality within your application, you would bind JavaScript functions to Bootstrap 
          components such as buttons and forms. These functions would handle the creation, reading, updating, and 
          deletion of data within your application's state or database.

          Overall, by combining React with Bootstrap, you can create a robust and visually appealing CRUD 
          application that provides users with a smooth and intuitive experience for managing data.
